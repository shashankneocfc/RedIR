Nemanja Matic, the rock and foundation of the Chelsea FC squad, will miss the most important game of the Blues season thus far, the Capital One Cup final, on Sunday, at Wembley, against Tottenham.

Matic and Cesc Fabregas have paired together to form the midfield pivot of Chelsea’s 4-2-3-1, with Matic’s defensive strengths allowing Fabregas to control the offense. Indeed, while Fabregas, Oscar and Willian have all slipped in and out of the side, Matic has remained, missing just one game the whole season (the 2-1 loss at Newcastle; many attributed the loss to Matic’s absence).

He has been paired not just with the more attacking Fabregas, but also, successfully, with John Obi Mikel — a player in his mold — and Ramires. All three pairings have worked brilliantly, and all three have been focused on Matic. The side depends on him sitting in front of the back line.

When Matic is on his game, he is able to do just that, covering John Terry and Gary Cahill’s problems with pacey strikers. Often, when Branislav Ivanovic is marauding up the wing, Matic will drop into the right back slot, covering for Ivanovic as well.

It is notable that in Chelsea’s two losses in the Premier League, this season, Matic was absent, either in body or in form. Against Newcastle, the Serbian was suspended for yellow card accumulation. Papiss Cisse tore apart the Blues back line on the counter with his speed. Then, a month later, Chelsea got hammered on the road against Spurs, the very side this final is against, 5-3.

Harry Kane scored a brace, having pulled Gary Cahill out of position, and then blowing by him, time and again. Normally, Matic would have stopped Kane from picking up speed, but the Serbian was off his game that day, and Chelsea paid a heavy price for it.

In light of how integral Matic is to Chelsea’s chances, the fact that he is going to miss the final, rightly or wrongly, has put much doubt in Blues fans minds, especially after January’s poor result. Although Spurs have consistently lost to Chelsea in the Premier League, never having won at Stamford Bridge, the recent form of Mauricio Pochettino’s men has heightened tensions.
