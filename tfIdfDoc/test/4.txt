Seven men sought by police investigating racist chanting at a railway station after a Chelsea Champions League football match this month have all been identified, police said.

British Transport Police said the men would be interviewed in due course.

Police had released images of seven men taken at St Pancras station in London at around 8pm on 18 February.

This was the day after a separate incident on the Paris Metro before Chelsea’s match with Paris Saint-Germain when a man was subjected to alleged racist abuse.
