So what happened? How did Guillermo Vilas earn three more titles on the day Rafael Nadal was about to tie him? It’s because folks in Argentina, including Vilas himself, fairly noted that the original number had been wrong all along. Vilas’s two titles in Toronto (1974 and 1976) and one in Virginia Beach (1977) had actually come on clay, not on hard court, as was originally believed by the ATP and ITF. So while Vilas’s overall tournament wins didn’t change, his clay and hard court victories did. (To the credit of tennis message
 boards, they had this snuffed out a while ago.)
