Roman Abramovich hasn't always had a lot of luck with big-money strikers at Chelsea. Signed for the first time 11 years ago, Didier Drogba was clearly a palpable hit, while Fernando Torres offered mostly misses for 50 million pounds. Andrei Shevchenko was another crushing disappointment who never seemed more than a fraction of the player he had once been. Mateja Kezman, Adrian Mutu, Hernan Crespo, for one reason or another, none of them enjoyed the success his price tag implied.

But with Diego Costa, that losing streak of strikers has been emphatically ended.

Fittingly, it was Drogba who first congratulated Costa as he replaced him deep into injury time, nodding with huge approval and patting his colleague heartily on the back. The Ivorian knows that the torch has been passed, but it's hard to imagine a more worthy successor. There are many differences in the style of the two men, but they share the same ferocity. No defender has ever seen their names on the team sheet without grimacing in recognition of what would await them.
