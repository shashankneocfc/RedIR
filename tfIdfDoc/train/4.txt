It wasn’t a great performance from Chelsea, but it was a ruthless one, and it shows why they are the best side in the England. They lacked fluency, yes, and they conceded possession for long periods, but they had a plan and ultimately they were far too professional and ruthless for a good Tottenham Hotspur side.

 Chelsea legend replaces a Chelsea legend in the making. Didier Drogba is on, Diego Costa is off. A grinning Drogba applauds Costa off.
 
 Chart nonsense pumps out around the stadium as Chelsea’s players walk up to the Royal Box to collect the trophy. It really is the only way to celebrate winning a football match.
 
 The Tottenham players have collected their loser’s medals. Most of their fans have disappeared.

 After a quick phone call, presumably to his wife, Jose Mourinho is on the pitch to celebrate with his players. It’s his first trophy since he won the Spanish Super Cup in 2012.
